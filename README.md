# OVERVIEW
This programming project is the first step in the application process for the JHBanno summer internship.
The goal of this assignment is to retrieve HTML data from Banno.com through HTTP. 
Once the data has been received, there are five analytical functions that the program must perform on the data:
- A count of the number of Platform Features offered.
- The top 3 occuring alphanumeric characters contained in the HTML, and how many times each occurs.
- The number of .png images in the HTML.
- BannoJHA’s Twitter handle: this should work if the Twitter name were to change.
- The number of times the term “financial institution” occurs in text.
